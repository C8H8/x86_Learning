# x86_Learning
Collection of x86_64 assembly projects I've made while learning x86 assembly.
Most of these projects will be for Linux, but some may be for Windows and other platforms.
I can't say all the code will be original. A lot of these have lines taken form tutorials.

## What is comlink.sh?
comlink.sh is just a small program so I don't have to type the assemble and link commands. It's called "comlink" because in my head I wasthinking compile-link, even though it's assemble-link. Also, asslink is a worse name, so comlink it is. I may modify it to make it a better, more complete program later on.
